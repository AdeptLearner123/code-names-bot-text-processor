    of which Asia forms the eastern (and greater) part and includes the British Isles,
    Iceland, and most of the Mediterranean islands. Its recent history has been dominated
    by the decline of European states from their former colonial and economic preeminence,
    the emergence of the European Union among the wealthy democracies of western Europe,
    and the collapse of the Soviet Union with consequent changes of power in central
    and eastern Europe.
